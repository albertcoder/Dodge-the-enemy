# Clasic Arcade Game Project | Udacity FEND Nanodegree | 2018
Project 3 for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program; completed as part of the Grow with Google Scholarship Program, 2018.

A classic arcade game based on Frogger that required students to use object-oriented JavaSCript to implement functionality to the provided art assets and game engine.

## Authors

Albert added to and edited code and assets provided by Udacity.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to create a copy on your local machine. Click [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/ "GitHub Help — Clone a Repository") for help with this task from GitHub.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. Some tips for doing this from Help Desk Geek are available [here](https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/open-an-html-file-in-google-chrome/ ).

    * As an alternative to steps one and two, you can run the repository's `index.html` file on [HTML Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://albertcoder.github.io/Dodge-the-enemy/).

3. Start playing!

## Playing the Game

* Your mission: get your avatar "home" to the destination on the other side of the canvas without colliding with any "enemies" — in this case: bugs.
* To control player: use arrow keys — up, down, right and left.
* If you collide with an enemy, your player will move back to the start position.
* After your player makes it "home" safely, you will have the option of selecting to play again.

## Acknowledgements

* Udacity.com supplied the initial HTML file, art assets, game engine and image loading utility for this project.

   * The author implemented the game's functionality by editing the app.js file and, where necessary, the engine.js file, utilizing object-oriented JavaScript wiht ES6 class syntax. The author also added headings and a popover to the HTML file, and styled both with CSS, and implemented popover functionality.

* Portions of Udacity student Matthew Cranford's series of "Arcade Game Walkthrough" posts on the project were consulted: https://matthewcranford.com/. Udacity student Jacob Olson also helped in person implementing the game functionality including the cancelAnimation function during the meetups.

* The popover markup, stylings and implementation were adapted from code found in w3schools' post "How TO - CSS/JS Modal": https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp.

* This README was based on a template provided by Billie Thompson posting under the name "PurpleBooth" at https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2. A post by Matias Singers posting under the username "matiassingers" at https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme was also consulted.

* Udacity's FEND Nanodegree program provided the structure and much of the information I needed to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript -- including object-oriented JS -- which allowed me to successfully complete this project. My fellow Udacity students as well as the wider programming community also provided indispensable information, resources, support and encouragement.

* Funding for my learning through Udacity including this project comes courtesy of the Grow with Google Scholarship program.
